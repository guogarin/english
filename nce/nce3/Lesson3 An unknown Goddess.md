# 1. `Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea.`
## 1.1 make a discovery (of…) 
discover → make an interesting discovery (of …) 
### 仿写
#### (1) use 
→make use of …→make the best use of
He made the best use of his talent. 

#### (2) describe 
make a vivid description of … 

#### (3) investigate 
make a thorough`/ˈθɜːroʊ/` investigation of … 
 
#### (4) summarize 
make a comprehensive summary of … 

#### (5) analyze 
make a detailed analysis of … 

## 1.2 为什么要用被动语态写成`an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists`，而不是用主动语态写成`archaeologists made an interesting discovery`呢？
因为，如果写成
> Some time ago, **archaeologists made an interesting discovery** on the Aegean island of Kea. 
> 
那句子强调的就是 考古学家(archaeologists)，而不是强调这个有趣的考古发现，那么后文就应该着笔墨于这些考古学家。而本文讨论的是这个有趣的考古发现，因此应该按文中这么写才能突出这个考古发现。 再举个例子：
> (NCE3-32 P150-L3) A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search.  
> 本句中，作者像突出的是`a radio message`，而不是收到这封电报的人。
>

## 2.1 an American team
an American team( of archaeologists )

## 2.2 stand
### ### 2.2.1 释义
v. 位于（某处）
&emsp;&emsp; stand一般是主动语态，表示“矗立在”，一般表示一个房子、柱子等，城市一般不会用stand来表示“位于（某处）”，因为城市太大了。
> (NCE3-18 P82-L4) Strange forms **stand** in gardens, and outside buildings and shops. 
> 
> The Monument to the People’s Heroes **stands** in the center of Tian’anmen Square.

> 

### 2.2.4 `lie`

`cape`: a very large piece of land sticking out into the sea 



&emsp; 
# 3. `The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization.`
## 3.1  at one time
在这里`at one time` = `once`（曾经）
## 3.2 must have been的替代
> The city at one time must have seen/known（经历） prosperity. 
> 

## 3.3 enjoy
### 3.3.1 释义
v. [动词+名词短语] (formal)享有；享受
`to have sth good that is an advantage to you`
